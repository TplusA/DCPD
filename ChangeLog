2015-12-16  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.7 released.

	* XMODEM: Fix CRC-16 computation; checksum is to be computed only for
	  the payload itself, not for the command header.

2015-12-08  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.6 released.

	* Networking: WLAN configuration is global and not bound to specific
	  interfaces. Swapping WLAN adapters while the system is running or
	  plugging in more than one adapter leads to undefined system
	  behavior.

	* Updates: System update can be started by SPI slave.

	* Bug fix: Fixed a crash.

2015-12-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.5 released.

	* Networking: WLAN site survey can be started by SPI slave, list of
	  discovered WLAN networks can be read out when done.

	* Misc: Several internal optimizations and improvements.

2015-11-02  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* System shutdown: Use systemd and logind to inhibit system shutdown
	  until it is safe to do so. Files are closed when power off or reboot
	  is due. Corresponding internal APIs do not allow opening any new
	  files in this case.

	* DCP system reboot: Sending code 0x24/0x20 to register 40 triggers a
	  system reboot. This is implemented by sending a reboot request to
	  systemd.

	* DCP system power off: Sending DRC command for power off triggers a
	  system power down. This is implemented by sending a power off
	  request to systemd.

	* DCP status: Register 17 isn't fake anymore.

2015-09-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* TCP tunnel: Initial implementation of TCP tunnels for incoming
	  connections (server side).

	  The SPI slave may ask to open one or more tunnels on any TCP port.
	  The Streaming Board will then listen on that port and forward any
	  data exchanged between the SPI slave and connecting clients using
	  DCP registers 119, 120, and 121.

	  It is not possible to initiate outgoing connections to external
	  servers using these kind of TCP tunnels.

2015-09-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* Download files: Initial implementation of downloading files from the
	  internet using registers 40, 41, and 209. Requires D-Bus DL daemon.

	* XMODEM: Initial implementation of file transfers via XMODEM protocol
	  over DCP (registers 40, 41, 44, and 45). After a file that has been
	  downloaded by D-Bus DL, it's contents can be read by the SPI slave.

	* Misc: Various cosmetic changes.

2015-07-13  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.1 released.

	* Implement reading of network status register (register 50).
	  Also, status changes are automatically sent to the slave.

	* Implement reading software image build ID (register 37).

	* Show version information in log, add --version option.

2015-06-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* First release for testing.
