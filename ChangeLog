2016-09-30  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 2.2 released.

	* Networking: Enable use of ConnMan v1.33, supposedly fixing a few
	  networking problems. We now use D-Bus to push configuration changes
	  to ConnMan, and we implement the ConnMan agent API let ConnMan ask
	  for credentials. Network configuration data is stored in our own
	  configuration file, no more direct manipulation of files owned by
	  ConnMan.

2016-07-21  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 2.1 released.

	* Performance: Reduce amount of log messages to spare CPU cycles. This
	  is supposed to avoid stuttering audio playback at the start of
	  streams.

2016-06-27  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 2.0 released.

	* Communication with dcpspi: Major changes in the protocol between
	  dcpspi and dcpd. A small protocol has been added that encapsulates
	  DCP to get collision handling and synchronization right.

	  Collision handling is done completely within dcpd now (was mixed
	  handling in v1.x versions).

	* IP tunnel: Improved error messages.

2016-05-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.20 released.

	* UPnP: SPI slave can set the UPnP friendly name (register 88).

	* TA Control: Synchronize Airable login status between device and app.

	* Airable services: Allow SPI slave to delete service credentials for
	  services like Tidal. The device then automatically logs out from the
	  service.

	* DCP protocol: Proper protocol versioning. We are now at protocol
	  level 1.0.1. Setting the protocol to a specific level (this is
	  something which cannot be done from the outside at the moment) will
	  choose the register implementations as are correct for the selected
	  protocol level.

	* DCP protocol: Initial support for setting the appliance ID (register
	  87). The ID can be read out, but writing is not supported in this
	  version (writes are accepted and ignored). Also, the ID has no
	  effect whatsoever; it has been introduced only to get the DCP
	  command into the protocol implementation as soon as possible.

2016-05-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.19 released.

	* Stability: Fix concurrent access to meta data structure, very rarely
	  leading to messed up meta data, or maybe even crashes.

	* D-Bus: Adapt to latest changes in Streamplayer D-Bus interfaces.
	  Requires streamplayer 1.8 because of incompatible changes.

	* D-Bus: Adapt to latest changes in Airable authentication D-Bus
	  interfaces. Requires listbrokers 1.18 because of incompatible
	  changes.

2016-04-26  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.18 released.

	* TA Control: Detect broken connection between Streaming Board and
	  smartphone app in case the connection dies silently. This feature
	  comes at a minor prices: TCP keepalive with interval of 30 seconds
	  is employed, increasing overall network traffic a bit.

	* TA Control: The next stream register notification is avoided when
	  continuing playing a paused stream.

	* DCP protocol: Support SPI protocol level negotiation (register 1).

2016-04-14  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.17 released.

	* TA Control: Support structured meta data sent by smartphone app.

2016-04-08  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.16 released.

	* TA Control: Send information about externally started stream around.
	  The information is distributed via D-Bus signal. This information is
	  supposed to be caught by the user interface which should use it to
	  generate proper DRC screen updates.

2016-03-23  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.15 released.

	* DRCP: Recognize command codes 0x21 and 0x22 for fast scrolling
	  through lists.

2016-03-15  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.14 released.

	* Networking: Accept empty WLAN passphrases for unprotected networks.

	* Streaming: Activate play view when playing via register 79.

2016-03-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.13 released.

	* DCP protocol: Support search queries through register 74.

	* DCP protocol: URL registers are 1024 bytes now (were 512 bytes in
	  previous versions). This allows the SPI slave to process very long
	  URLs.

	* TA Control: Fix processing of Airable authentication URL requests.
	  Locale and IP address parameters were confused.

2016-02-18  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.12 released.

	* DCP protocol: Fix handling of unsupported registers.

	* DCP protocol: Fix spurious loss of protocol synchronization.

2016-02-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.11 released.

	* Airable services: Fix bug that prevented the SPI slave to send
	  service credentials for external services.

	* Bug fix: Avoid log disruption by very long messages.

2016-02-08  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.10 released.

	* TA Control: Support Airable access from smartphone app (small
	  protocol spoken on TCP port 8466). It is possible for the app to
	  establish connections with Airable by using passwords generated by
	  the Streaming Board. There is no reason to put the secret key into
	  the app anymore. Further, it is possible to read out credentials for
	  external services such a Tidal.

	* Airable services: Allow SPI slave to read out and manipulate
	  service credentials for services like Tidal. This is done through
	  new register 106.

2016-01-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.9 released.

	* Streaming: Allow smartphone apps to queue streams.

	* Streaming: Tell SPI slave title and URL of currently playing stream
	  through registers 75 and 76. This is necessary to get the
	  communication with the smartphone app on the SPI slave right.

	* Network status: Fix register 50 updates.

	* Misc: Various cosmetic changes.

2016-01-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.8 released.

	* WLAN: Attempt switching to WLAN mode when removing Ethernet cable.

	* Network configuration: Improve interoperability with SPI slave.

2015-12-16  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.7 released.

	* XMODEM: Fix CRC-16 computation; checksum is to be computed only for
	  the payload itself, not for the command header.

2015-12-08  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.6 released.

	* Networking: WLAN configuration is global and not bound to specific
	  interfaces. Swapping WLAN adapters while the system is running or
	  plugging in more than one adapter leads to undefined system
	  behavior.

	* Updates: System update can be started by SPI slave.

	* Bug fix: Fixed a crash.

2015-12-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.5 released.

	* Networking: WLAN site survey can be started by SPI slave, list of
	  discovered WLAN networks can be read out when done.

	* Misc: Several internal optimizations and improvements.

2015-11-02  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* System shutdown: Use systemd and logind to inhibit system shutdown
	  until it is safe to do so. Files are closed when power off or reboot
	  is due. Corresponding internal APIs do not allow opening any new
	  files in this case.

	* DCP system reboot: Sending code 0x24/0x20 to register 40 triggers a
	  system reboot. This is implemented by sending a reboot request to
	  systemd.

	* DCP system power off: Sending DRC command for power off triggers a
	  system power down. This is implemented by sending a power off
	  request to systemd.

	* DCP status: Register 17 isn't fake anymore.

2015-09-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* TCP tunnel: Initial implementation of TCP tunnels for incoming
	  connections (server side).

	  The SPI slave may ask to open one or more tunnels on any TCP port.
	  The Streaming Board will then listen on that port and forward any
	  data exchanged between the SPI slave and connecting clients using
	  DCP registers 119, 120, and 121.

	  It is not possible to initiate outgoing connections to external
	  servers using these kind of TCP tunnels.

2015-09-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* Download files: Initial implementation of downloading files from the
	  internet using registers 40, 41, and 209. Requires D-Bus DL daemon.

	* XMODEM: Initial implementation of file transfers via XMODEM protocol
	  over DCP (registers 40, 41, 44, and 45). After a file that has been
	  downloaded by D-Bus DL, it's contents can be read by the SPI slave.

	* Misc: Various cosmetic changes.

2015-07-13  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.1 released.

	* Implement reading of network status register (register 50).
	  Also, status changes are automatically sent to the slave.

	* Implement reading software image build ID (register 37).

	* Show version information in log, add --version option.

2015-06-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* First release for testing.
